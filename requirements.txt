Now, let's get started.

### **Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub**

1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the **+** icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  Give your repository a name, for example, `SAHA-AI-Assistant`.
4.  **Very Important:** Leave all the checkboxes (for README, .gitignore, etc.) **unchecked**. We want to start with a completely empty repository. 
5.  Click the green **"Create repository"** button.

On the next page, you will see a URL under the "HTTPS" option. **Keep this page open**, as we will need to copy that URL in a moment.

### **Step 2: Prepare Your Local Project**

Now, let's get your code ready on your computer.

1.  Open your terminal (like Command Prompt or PowerShell).
2.  Navigate to your project folder by running this command:
    ```bash
    cd D:\Chatbot_Stock_Market
    ```
3.  Now, initialize Git in this folder by running:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    You should see a message saying `Initialized empty Git repository...`

### **Step 3: Make Your First "Commit"**

A commit is like a snapshot of your project's progress.

1.  First, we need to tell Git to track all your project files. Run this command:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
2.  Now, let's save this snapshot with a descriptive message. Run:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit of SAHA-AI project"
    ```

---
### **Step 4: Connect and Push to GitHub**

This is the final step where we upload your code.

1.  First, it's good practice to make sure your main branch is called `main`. Run:
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```
2.  Now, go back to that GitHub page you kept open and **copy the HTTPS URL**.
3.  In your terminal, run the following command, but **replace the URL** with the one you just copied:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
    ```
4.  Finally, push your code to GitHub by running:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
