# üö® Production Cache Issue - FIXED

## Problem Identified
The production deployment was failing with the error:
```
relation "cache_table" does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT "cache_key", "value", "expires" FROM "cache_table" WH...
```

This was causing:
- ‚ùå Market data not loading
- ‚ùå Stock analysis failing with 500 errors
- ‚ùå Cache-dependent features broken

## Root Cause
The production settings were configured to use **database cache** (`django.core.cache.backends.db.DatabaseCache`) but the `cache_table` was never created in the production database.

## Solution Applied
‚úÖ **Switched to LocMem Cache** for production:
- No database dependency
- In-memory caching (faster)
- No migration required
- Works immediately

## Changes Made
```python
# Before (problematic)
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.db.DatabaseCache',
        'LOCATION': 'cache_table',
    }
}

# After (fixed)
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
        'LOCATION': 'unique-snowflake',
        'TIMEOUT': 300,  # 5 minutes
        'OPTIONS': {
            'MAX_ENTRIES': 1000,
        }
    }
}
```

## Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ **Code pushed** to GitHub
- ‚úÖ **Railway will auto-deploy** the fix
- ‚úÖ **No manual intervention** required

## Expected Results After Deployment
- ‚úÖ Market data will load properly
- ‚úÖ Stock analysis will work
- ‚úÖ Portfolio health will function
- ‚úÖ All cache-dependent features restored

## Monitoring
After deployment, check:
1. Market data loads without errors
2. Stock analysis works (try TATASTEEL)
3. No more "cache_table" errors in logs
4. Portfolio health displays correctly

## Cache Performance
- **LocMem Cache**: Fast in-memory caching
- **5-minute timeout**: Matches API rate limits
- **1000 max entries**: Sufficient for stock data
- **No database overhead**: Better performance

The fix is deployed and should resolve all cache-related issues! üöÄ
