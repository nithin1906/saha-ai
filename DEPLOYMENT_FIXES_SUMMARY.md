# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Date: October 2, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Critical: AttributeError in Middleware** ‚úÖ
- **Error**: `AttributeError: 'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'user'`
- **Location**: `/app/users/middleware.py`, line 61
- **Cause**: Custom middleware was placed before Django's `AuthenticationMiddleware` in the middleware stack
- **Impact**: Health checks failing, preventing successful deployment

**Fix Applied**:
- Reordered middleware in `core/settings_production.py`
- Moved `SecurityLoggingMiddleware` and `InviteOnlyMiddleware` AFTER `AuthenticationMiddleware`
- This ensures `request.user` is available when custom middleware runs

### 2. **Critical: Health Check Endpoint Failure** ‚úÖ
- **Error**: Health checks timing out and failing
- **Cause**: `/health` endpoint was subject to authentication middleware checks
- **Impact**: Railway health checks failing, causing deployment restarts

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `InviteOnlyMiddleware` to skip `/health/` path
- Updated `SecurityLoggingMiddleware` to skip `/health/` path
- Health endpoint now responds immediately without auth checks

### 3. **High: Database Connection During Migrations** üîß
- **Error**: `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed`
- **Cause**: `DATABASE_URL` environment variable not properly configured in Railway
- **Impact**: Migrations failing, app starting without proper database schema

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced `start.sh` with database URL validation
- Added better error messages for database connection failures
- Improved migration error handling with diagnostics
- Updated `build.sh` to only install dependencies (migrations run at startup)

**Still Required**:
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in Railway environment variables
- Ensure PostgreSQL service is properly linked to the app

## Files Modified

1. **core/settings_production.py**
   - Line 127-139: Reordered middleware stack
   
2. **users/middleware.py**
   - Line 16-21: Added health check skip in `InviteOnlyMiddleware`
   - Line 61-64: Added health check skip in `SecurityLoggingMiddleware`

3. **start.sh**
   - Line 12-20: Added DATABASE_URL validation
   - Line 39-63: Improved migration error handling
   
4. **build.sh**
   - Simplified to only install dependencies
   - Removed static file collection (now in start.sh)

5. **RAILWAY_FIX_GUIDE.md** (New)
   - Comprehensive deployment guide
   - Configuration checklist
   - Troubleshooting steps

## Next Steps for Railway Deployment

### Before Deploying:
1. ‚úÖ Code changes committed
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify PostgreSQL database is added to Railway project
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Check environment variables in Railway:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (auto-set when PostgreSQL added)
   - `SECRET_KEY` (must set manually)
   - `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings_production`
   - `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (your Railway domain)

### Deploy:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment: middleware order, health checks, and database"
git push origin main
```

### After Deploying:
1. Monitor Railway logs for:
   - ‚úÖ "DATABASE_URL is set"
   - ‚úÖ "Migrations completed successfully"
   - ‚úÖ "Starting Gunicorn"
   - ‚úÖ Health check passing
   
2. Test endpoints:
   - `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health` ‚Üí Should return `{"status": "healthy"}`
   - `https://your-app.up.railway.app/` ‚Üí Should load app

## Testing Locally

To verify fixes work locally:

```bash
# Set up environment
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings_production
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db"
export SECRET_KEY="test-secret-key-for-local-testing"

# Run server
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Expected Deployment Flow

```
1. Railway receives push
2. Runs build.sh (installs dependencies)
3. Runs start.sh:
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Validates DATABASE_URL exists
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tests Django setup
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Runs migrations (should succeed now)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Collects static files
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Starts Gunicorn
4. Health checks begin hitting /health
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Should pass immediately (no auth required)
5. Deployment marked as successful ‚úÖ
```

## Rollback Plan

If deployment still fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Manually add PostgreSQL if not present
4. Check that database service is running
5. If needed, revert changes:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```
