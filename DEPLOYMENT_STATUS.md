## 📊 Expected Deployment URL
Your app should be available at:
- **Primary**: `https://saha-ai.up.railway.app`
- **Alternative**: `https://web-production-db25.up.railway.app`

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **1. Wait for Deployment**
- Railway typically takes 2-5 minutes to deploy
- Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
- Look for "Deployed" status

### **2. Test Key Endpoints**
Once deployed, test these URLs:

**Market Data:**
- `https://your-app.up.railway.app/advisor/market/snapshot/`

**Mutual Fund Search (Main Fix):**
- `https://your-app.up.railway.app/advisor/search/MF/HDFC`
- `https://your-app.up.railway.app/advisor/mutual-fund/categories/`
- `https://your-app.up.railway.app/advisor/mutual-fund/`

**Fund Details:**
- `https://your-app.up.railway.app/advisor/mutual-fund/HDFC002/`

### **3. Expected Results**
- **JSON responses** with comprehensive fund data
- **No more empty responses** for MF search
- **Real-looking fund information** with NAV, AMC, categories
- **Fast response times** (< 2 seconds)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If Deployment Fails:**
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check database connection

### **If APIs Don't Work:**
1. Verify the app URL is correct
2. Check if endpoints return JSON (not HTML)
3. Test with Postman collection

### **If MF Search Still Empty:**
1. Check if `mf_data_service.py` is properly imported
2. Verify the new endpoints are accessible
3. Test the categories endpoint first

## 📱 Postman Testing
1. Import `postman_collection.json`
2. Set `base_url` to your Railway app URL
3. Test all endpoints systematically
4. Verify JSON responses with fund data

## 🎯 Success Indicators
- ✅ MF search returns comprehensive fund data
- ✅ Categories endpoint shows 6 fund categories
- ✅ Fund details show complete information
- ✅ Market data works as before
- ✅ All endpoints return JSON (not HTML)

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete
2. Test the live endpoints
3. Verify MF search functionality
4. Report any issues for quick fixes

The enhanced MF search should now work perfectly on the deployed app! 🚀
